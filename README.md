# WeatherApp

About:
I developed a weather application with geolocation functionality, prompting users for location access upon website load. Using the Geolocation API and OpenWeatherMap API, the app fetches and displays real-time weather information based on the user's current location. This feature works alongside a manual city search, providing a comprehensive weather overview with temperature, city name, weather conditions, and real-time images. Additionally, I expanded the app to include details like humidity and wind speed for each city, enhancing the user experience. This project utilized JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and APIs for seamless integration and functionality.
